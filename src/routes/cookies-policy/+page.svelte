                    thanks to these cookies that those websites can “remember” your actions and preferences
                    (e.g., login data, language, font size, other display settings, etc.), so that you do not need
                    to configure them again when you next visit the website, or when you change pages within
                    a website.

                    Cookies are used for electronic authentication, monitoring of sessions and storage of
                    information regarding your activities when accessing a website. They may also contain a
                    unique ID code which allows tracking of your browsing activities within a website, for

                    There are various types of cookies, depending on their characteristics and functions, which

                    are automatically deleted when you close your browser, and “persistent cookies”, which

                    network, or which are needed to provide services you request – typically do not require
                    this consent. This includes browsing or session cookies (used to allow users to login) and
                    function cookies (used to remember choices made by a user when accessing the website,
                    such as language or products selected for purchase).

                    to send advertising messages in line with the preferences revealed by users while browsing
                    websites – typically require specific consent from users, although this may vary according
